However when user scroll's down to the end of the page then more headlines are loaded dynamically upto three pages for each scroll respectively and the base url changes to \"https://in.investing.com/equities/hdfc-bank-ltd-news/3\". After that the page appears a Show More button at the end of the news headlines section where user can click the button to show more headlines. This cycles repeats until the end of the headlines. This python script is designed to tackle this cycle. Since the page is designes in such a way the extraction of data leaves approx 5 rows blank space for each iteration of page and the datetime leaves two rows blank (See CSV file in excel)."
